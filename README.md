# About

This is a simple repository of simple algorithms for reference, and for interview 
questions. Please feel free to contribute, or simply look. 

The folder structure should be the name of the problem with a subdirectory specifying 
the attempt number and the language/technique used. Something like the following

```
.
├── binary-tree
├── fibonachi
└── n-ary-tree
    └── 1_haskell
```
